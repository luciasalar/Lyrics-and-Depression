Affective Impact of Music Vs. Lyrics



While the music alone increased positive affect and decreased depression, the lyrics plus music had the opposite effect. In Experiment 2, the sad lyrics plus music also increased depression and decreased positive affect even when performed in an up-beat style. Experiment 3 showed that pairing the melody with the sad lyrics led subjects to rate the melody alone as less pleasant one week later. Lyrics, thus, appear to have greater power to direct mood change than music alone and can imbue a particular melody with affective qualities.




Songs and emotions: are lyrics and melodies equal partners?



The major findings in Experiments 1 and 2 were that lyrics detracted from the emotion in happy and calm music (positive emotions), but enhanced the emotion in sad and angry music (negative emotions). In all cases, melodies of songs were more dominant than the lyrics in eliciting emotions. In addition, in Experiments 3 and 4, the emotion in the songs appeared to transfer, simply by association, to pictures of common objects arbitrarily paired with the songs.


The pleasures of sad music: a systematic review
. We offer a framework to account for how listening to sad music can lead to positive feelings, contending that this effect hinges on correcting an ongoing homeostatic imbalance. Sadness evoked by music is found pleasurable: (1) when it is perceived as non-threatening; (2) when it is aesthetically pleasing; and (3) when it produces psychological benefits such as mood regulation, and empathic feelings, caused, for example, by recollection of and reflection on past events. We also review neuroimaging studies related to music and emotion and focus on those that deal with sadness.
